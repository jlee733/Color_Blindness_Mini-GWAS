# Color Blindness Mini-GWAS

In this GWAS, we created a binary classifier by preprocessing 23andMe genotype data to determine whether an individual has color blindness or not based off their SNPs. The classifier was evaluated using an ROC curve. In addition, the significant SNPs were also searched within the NCBI database to observe any clinical relevance from biological pathways.
